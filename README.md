# Multi-Stack Authentication

This repository explores authentication systems implemented across multiple technology stacks.  
It started as a Java mini‑project for login/registration, and has since expanded to include PHP modules and a front‑end clone of Quora’s login page using HTML & CSS.

---

## 📌 Overview
The repo demonstrates different approaches to user authentication:
- **Java Auth**  
  - `basic/` – Simple login/registration.  
  - `mvc/` – Model–View–Controller structured login system.  
  - `web/` – Web‑based authentication using JSP/Servlets.  
- **PHP Auth**  
  - Authentication modules built with PHP for server‑side validation.  
- **HTML & CSS (Quora Clone)**  
  - A static front‑end project mimicking Quora’s login page design.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Java, PHP, HTML, CSS  
- **Libraries/Tools**:  
  - Java Compiler (JDK)  
  - JSP/Servlets (for web module)  
  - Any text editor or IDE (VS Code, Eclipse, etc.)

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Java Modules
1. Navigate to the desired sub‑folder (`basic`, `mvc`, or `web`).
2. Compile:
   ```bash
   javac file_name.java
   ```
3. Run:
   ```bash
   java file_name
   ```
   *Note: In the MVC module & basic module, `ViewPage.java` invokes other components.*

### PHP Module
- Run on a local server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or PHP built‑in server).
- Place files in the server’s root directory and access via browser.

### HTML & CSS (Quora Clone)
- Open the HTML file directly in a browser to view the login page design.

## 🚧 Project Status
- Java modules support basic login/registration flows.  
- Planned enhancement: **Email verification** for secure access.  
- PHP and HTML/CSS modules demonstrate alternative stacks and UI design.

---

## 🧪 Testing
- Example credentials for Java registration:  
  - `user_id = 1001`  
  - `password = Login@01`

✨ This repo serves as a learning playground for building and comparing authentication systems across multiple stacks.
